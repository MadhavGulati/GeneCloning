Genetic modification is a concept that is all around us in our daily worlds, but most people don't realize it. Gene Cloning is an interactive app that demonstrates how gene cloning works, by making a fish glow! This app was built with *SwiftUI* as well as *AVFoundation*, *SpriteKit*, *ARKit*, and other frameworks to deliver this interactive experience.

## Try it Out!
Download the .swiftpm file above to your iOS device and run it through the iOS Swift Playgrounds app!

## Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: Used for the app layout, UI elements, drag and drop functionality, and overall design.
- **AVFoundation**: Used for the audio effects and sounds.
- **SpriteKit**: Used for the fish animation at the end scene.
- **ARKit**: Used for the 3D AugmentedReality scene at the end.

## Open Source Resources

- **IrregularGradients**: A Swift framework that allows you to easily create animated gradient backgrounds. Used for the home page and walkthrough screens. [Found here](https://github.com/joogps/IrregularGradient)

- **Confetti animation**: An animation that makes confetti particles on the screen in SwiftUI, from this [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/creating-confetti-particle-effects-using-swiftui-afda4240de6b) by [Sarah](https://medium.com/@sarah.h.alsharif)

- **3D Fish**: A [model of a fish created by 3DGuru](https://usdzshare.com/?ug-gallery=photo-detail&photo_id=5148) on usdzshare.com, used for the Augmented Reality end screen.
